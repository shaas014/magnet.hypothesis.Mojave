### Magnet hypothesis: plant-pollinator interactions
**Purpose:** A test of the magnet hypothesis was examined in Mojave National Preserve by Ally Ruttan.    

**Hypothesis:** Floral resource island created by shrubs and the associated beneficiary annual plants will positively and non-additively influence pollinator visitation rates. 

**Predictions:**  
(1) The frequency and duration of pollinator visitations to annuals is greater under shrubs than in the paired-open microsites (magnet H because of concentration).  
(2) Annual plants under flowering entomophilous shrubs (*Larrea tridentata*) will have a higher frequency and duration of pollinator visitations than annual plants under anemophilous shrubs (*Ambrosia dumosa*) because of higher concentrations of suitable floral resources for pollinators (specificity of pollinator faciliation).  
(3) Shrubs with annuals in their understory will have a higher frequency and duration of pollinator visitations than shrubs without annuals due to increased concentrations of floral resources for pollinators (reverse magnet effect and reciprocal benefits).  
(4) Sites with both shrubs and annuals will have the highest frequency and duration of pollinator visitations to both the shrubs and the annuals (i.e. annuals under shrubs also with flowers are visited the most).

An interesting corollary is that there are appropriate floral resources for desert pollinators, that they discriminate, and that entomophilous and anemophilous shrubs facilitate flowering similarly.

###Modeling assumptions  
1. It is acceptable to aggregate all treatments into one vector.  
2. The best fit model included interaction terms (not additive) and nests insect.RTU within reps. However, contrasts of AIC scores suggest that the additive model was best fit and given data viz and non-orthogonality issues, a compelling argument can be made for an additive global model.
3. It is acceptable to treat each year separately and not in a single model (no Ambrosia in 2015 and different years).
4. It is acceptable to model only bee data because of data viz.
5. The appropriate model is a GLM with fixed effects. This assumes rep is fixed and not random effect in single-year models. A multi-year model would be modeled using glmer or glmer.nb because year would be treated as random.
6. Gamma is the most likely family in several instances. Tests with weibull and others did not change outcome.
7. The function lsmeans is the most appropriate for posthoc contrasts (main model has a nested effect). This is not always ideal. The function glht etc from multcomp package was also tested and performed similarly. The function lsmeansLT from lmerTest package if there is a random effect in model (and mixed) was similar and difflsmeans as well. The final option is to do a likelihood ratio post hoc tests with a chi-sq approximation (following main glmer fit). This involves fitting model then repeating with a null, intercept-only model and comparing the two fits.
8. Outliers should be removed.

###Interpretation  
1. Cannot ignore taxa specificity. Data viz clearly shows that bees were the only taxa to respond to treatments (and that by plotting without taxa this is lost).  
2. Larrea flowers are not as attractive to bees as annuals within this ecosystem.  
3. Bees repond to temp.
4. There is support for the single-magnet hypothesis.
5. Both shrub species can generally facilitate annuals through pollination.
6. There is no support for the double-magnet prediction, i.e. shrubs receive no reciprocal benefit or facilitation from annuals.
7. Bees are the most effective pollinators, i.e. they also spend the most time with flowers and likely are the most effective service pollinators.

###Supporting analyses
```{r supporting, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#test multiple vector data structure####
#RTU was not a factor in model, treat as response instead, i.e. number of different taxa as a richness response variable.  Also, include bees as a response. 

#test Rii####
