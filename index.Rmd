### Magnet hypothesis: plant-pollinator interactions
**Purpose:** A test of the magnet hypothesis was examined in Mojave National Preserve by Ally Ruttan.    

**Hypothesis:** Floral resource island created by shrubs and the associated beneficiary annual plants will positively and non-additively influence pollinator visitation rates. 

**Predictions:**  
(1) The frequency of pollinator visitations to annuals is greater under shrubs than in the paired-open microsites.  
(2) Annual plants under flowering entomophilous shrubs (*Larrea tridentata*) will have a higher frequency of pollinator visitations than annual plants under anemophilous shrubs (*Ambrosia dumosa*) because of higher concentrations of floral resources for pollinators.  
(3) Shrubs with annuals in their understory will have a higher frequency of pollinator visitations than shrubs without annuals due to increased concentrations of floral resources for pollinators.  
(4) Sites with both shrubs and annuals will have the highest frequency of pollinator visitations to both the shrubs and the annuals. 

An interesting corollary is that there are appropriate floral resources for desert pollinators, that they discriminate, and that entomophilous and anemophilous shrubs facilitate flowering similarly.

###Data wrangling
```{r library and data loads, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

#meta-data
meta <- read_csv("data/meta-data.csv")
kable(meta)

#data
data <- read_csv("data/MNP.2015.csv")
data

#tidy data to expand treatment column (current structure is a mix of two factors)

#visitation duration needs to be weighted by duration (i.e. total recording time to address sampling effort)

#frequency counts in a separate dataframe (weighted by duration of recording)

#total visitation.duration per experimental day
